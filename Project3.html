<p> The origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 AD.
 However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong mass production in the Philippines can 
only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong were originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called
the pied du roi ("foot of the king"), invented between the 1500s to the late 1700s. However, how it was introduced to the
Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the Spanish Empire, which was
then allied to France.

Regardless of origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger and was 
predominantly used as a weapon, not just a tool. The quick opening techniques ("flipping") were also developed in the 
Philippines. In contrast, the French pied du roi was primarily a folding ruler, with the knife only included in some 
specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they 
also commonly included a metal tang at a right angle from the end of the handle to aid in measuring. There were also 
very similar designs to the balisong produced in England in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the 
pied du roi. But like the latter they were primarily utilitarian tools. </p>
