        A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWDf1kZYuU">butterfly knife</a>, also known as a balisong or a
        Batangas knife, is a folding knife with two handles that can be
        rotated around to open and close.
        Balisongs originated in the Philippines, with versions of butterfly knives also existing in France for
        centuries.
        “Live” butterfly knives, or butterfly knives with sharp blades, hold varying legal statuses around the world:
        Some regions restrict ownership depending on the length of the blade, or allow collecting but not carrying.
        All live-bladed butterfly knives are prohibited in Canada. Instead, Canadian balisong enthusiasts use
        “trainers,”
        which are blunted or plastic butterfly knives, and are completely legal.

        In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand.
        Manipulations, called "flipping", are performed for art or amusement. Blunt "trainer" versions of these
        knives are available and can be used to practice tricks without the risk of injury.

    <h3> Why you should get a balisong? </h3>
    <article> The traditional folding knife is, without doubt, the standard for EDC purposes.

        However, folding knives have their drawbacks. The most common folding knives don't have a locking mechanism,
        which means your blade could slide open in your pocket.

        Butterfly knives have no such problem. Two different features make it safer to carry a butterfly knife than a
        folding one. First, the two handles completely conceal the blade.

        Additionally, most butterfly knives have a locking mechanism to keep the two blade handles together. Many
        butterfly knives are also smaller when closed than a folding knife. </article>
